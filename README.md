WE ARE USING JUPTERNOTEBOOK FOR ANALYSIS.

In this we are analysed the 911 calls which are taken from kaggle  and analyse what are the reasons that are called in 911 and it is visualized by plots
the first step we have gathered the data and it is loaded .
the second step we have check for missing data and filling it with its mean.
then we do data processing where the typecasting is done in order to analyse efficiently and new columns are aadded from existing one for better analysis.
then we visualize using some plots like counterplot,heatmap etc using python libraries.
